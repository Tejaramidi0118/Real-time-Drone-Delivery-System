# Drone Delivery Simulation

This project is a web-based application for simulating a drone delivery service in Hanamkonda, Telangana, India. The system allows users to define multiple delivery locations on a map, and the drone's flight path is automatically planned to avoid restricted no-fly zones. A real-time simulation visualizes the drone's movement and monitors its telemetry data, such as battery life, speed, and altitude.

##  Components

### 1. Flask Backend (`app.py`)
This is the core of the application, handling all the logic. It's built with Python using the Flask framework.

- **Geocoding:** It uses the Nominatim API via the `requests` library to convert human-readable addresses into geographic coordinates.
- **Path Planning:** The backend employs a **Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*)** algorithm to generate an optimal flight path. This algorithm is designed to find a path that avoids obstacles (no-fly zones) while minimizing the total distance. The path calculation also incorporates a simple battery-life model.
- **No-Fly Zones (NFZ):** No-fly zones are defined in a `nfz.geojson` file, which is generated by a Jupyter Notebook. These zones include areas around hospitals, schools, and malls to ensure safe operation.
- **Simulation:** A separate thread simulates the drone's flight along the planned path, updating its telemetry data in real time.
- **API Endpoints:** The backend exposes several REST API endpoints to communicate with the front-end, including `/geocode`, `/plan_path`, `/telemetry`, `/logs`, and `/reset`.

### 2. Frontend (`index.html`)
The user interface is a single HTML file.

- **Interactive Map:** The map is powered by **Leaflet.js**, an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. It displays the drone's base, delivery points, no-fly zones, and the planned flight path.
- **User Controls:** The interface provides controls for:
  - **Searching for locations:** A search bar with an autocomplete feature.
  - **Adding delivery points:** Users can click on the map to add delivery locations.
  - **Planning the path:** A "Plan Path" button triggers the RRT* algorithm on the backend.
  - **Running the simulation:** A "Start Simulation" button begins the drone's journey.
  - **Resetting the simulation:** A "Reset" button clears all markers and resets the drone's state.
- **Real-time Telemetry:** A dedicated panel displays live data from the drone, such as battery percentage, altitude, and speed, providing a dynamic user experience.

### 3. Geospatial Data Generation (`Project_Locations.ipynb`)
This Jupyter Notebook is a utility script used to define and visualize the operational area and no-fly zones.

- **OpenStreetMap Data:** It uses the `osmnx` library to fetch building footprints and points of interest from OpenStreetMap within a defined area (Ashoka Colony, Hanamkonda).
- **NFZ Creation:** It categorizes specific points of interest (e.g., hospitals, schools, colleges, malls) as no-fly zones and saves this data into a `nfz.geojson` file. This file is then used by the `app.py` backend for path planning.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `pip` for installing dependencies

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/drone-delivery-simulation.git](https://github.com/your-username/drone-delivery-simulation.git)
    cd drone-delivery-simulation
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Generate No-Fly Zones:**
    Run the `Project_Locations.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to create the `nfz.geojson` file. This step is crucial as the backend relies on this file for path planning.

4.  **Start the Flask server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5.  **Open the web interface:**
    Open `index.html` in your web browser.
